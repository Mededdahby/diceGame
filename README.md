# Dice Game

A simple two-player dice game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

This project is a basic implementation of a two-player dice game. Players take turns rolling a virtual die and accumulate scores. The first player to reach a total score greater than 10 wins the game.

## How to Play

1. Click the "NOUVEAU" (New) button to start a new game.
2. Click the "LANCE" (Roll) button to roll the virtual die.
3. Click the "PASSE" (Pass) button to pass the turn to the other player.
4. The game ends when one player's total score exceeds 10.

## Features

- **Random Dice Rolls:** The game uses JavaScript to simulate random dice rolls.
- **Player Turns:** Players take turns rolling the dice, and the active player is indicated by background color changes.
- **Score Tracking:** The scores for each player are displayed, and the game ends when a player's total score surpasses 10.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is designed to be responsive, providing a good user experience on different devices.
